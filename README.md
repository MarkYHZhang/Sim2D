# Sim2D
Online 2D immersive social network.

## Description
This is an online two-dimensional procedurally generated world. This is an attempt to change the way that people communicate online. It is blurring the line between online games and social media. It allows its users to chat in different virtual environments. This program uses JavaScript Canvas to perform the front-end rendering, and Spark Java for the back-end server.

## Screenshots coming soon!
